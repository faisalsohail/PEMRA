I might disagree with the analyst's views but nothing gives him the right to create public opinion that our beloved country is involved in cross border terrorism, sponsoring non-state separatists and training them. I believe a proper warning to the host, analyst and news channel should given. Wild accusation against your own state with a 100% certainty (his words ""iss mean koi shaqq nahi"") should be punished according to PEMRA rules and the program/channel should issue an apology to the people of Pakistan"

This dress has hurt my feelings and as a responsible citizen of the society I have moral obligation to launch a complaint against it. I think that wearing this type of dress by a young anchor and airing it in so prime time is just an attempt to promote nudity in the eastern society of Islamic Republic of Pakistan. The TV channel should be compelled to follow a dress code, especially for female anchors."

It seems though PEMRA is diligently allowing this to create unrest in this country. PEMRA must be ashamed of this and mend ways.

This show is aired on 6th April 2016 at about 9 30 to 10 am (objectable part). There are guests and that include a religious scholor at well. First of all why PEMRA can not just differentiate between a religious show and an entertainment show. What was higlihy disgraceful and completely objectable was the dance of all the female guests with the male guest and that too in front of the religious scholar sitting on the sofa. I felt it very disgraceful. Please look into this matter kindly. BAN (molvis) in entertainment shows to stop that disrespect by literally every channel. Secondly impose restrictions on dance and moderate clothing on TV. As it's not West where it is completely acceptable if one even comes in bikini. Please make TV the TV of Islamic Republic.

The insulting and disgusting comments were made by Mr. Aaqib Javed (Former Cricketer) & the whole pannel (Participants & Anchor) were also involved. Disgusting remarks about a province or linguistic group disturbs the unity of the nation and general environment. I suggest that PEMRA should issue a show cause notice to Dunya TV Channel and should also inquire the Team of Mazaq Raat for their attitude towards Phatans and Pakhtoons. In current scenario the nation needs harmony, unity, mutual respect and trust and I understand PEMRA should discourage such news channels and programmes who creates linguistic tussles and feelings of hatred among nation"

79414,Very little time slot is availble for religious programms. Negative thinking is being promoted. Talk shows have no positive discussion. Same talk for the last many years. nothing new. My suggestion is for channels seen in Pakistan and where PEMRA is applicable: Policy should be approved that % of time should be given to Religious programms and developing positve thinking. It is hard to find religious programms on TV channels. Most of the programms being shown on the TV channels are damaging the culture and it shows that no clear policy is behind it.

Media of a country shows its face. No one should be allowed to tarnish the face that Pakistan shows to the world. I am sure that the same is also the request of many common Pakistanis. Strict action should be taken against the TV Channel NEO that showed hatred towards Hindus in Pakistan as per the law of Pakistan.

He had Mr. Faisal Qureshi on the show and he took few young women from the audience and asked them to flirt with Mr. Faisal Qureshi and the winner will be the one who took Faisal Qureshi number in the most attractive way.

80340,What we saw in so called ramazan transmission regarding topic of Ahmedi community and Blasphemy laws. AAJ news and its anchor should be banned. First why Ahmedi is sitting in ramazan transmission because they are non Muslims and portraying they are Muslims so their thoughts are very dangerous for our Muslims community. What this anchor trying to portray where these bastered Ahmedi are already non Muslims in Pakistan resolution and blasphemy laws already defined.

The last half hour prior to the Iftar timings all channels are excessively showing advertisements. 2. Most Channels show the Azan-e-Maghrib for Lahore accompanied by Duas. The Azan a Maghrib for other cities are not shown. Even ”Capital TV” transmits Azan Maghrib for Lahore! 3. There are distracting talk shows which rob the sanctity of the crucial last half hour of Duas. 1. From 7:00 PM till 7:30 PM no advertisements should be aired and shown. 2. The last half hour period be exclusively devoted to showing Duas and AHadiths, no talk shows. 3. At least one channel each be earmarked to show to Azan-e-Maghrib for each of the major cities. At least PTV and Capital TV transmit Azan-e-Maghrib for Islamabad/Rawalpindi Area. Similarly other channels may be asked to transmit Azan-e-Maghrib for different cities."

Indian plays and cartoons always convey their religious teachings through their programs. While Hindi movies are not able to see with families. While Indian channels are also airing. If indian channels are airing in Pakistan then what is the need to telecast indian material in Pakistani Channels. I suggest to issue them show cause and restrict them to stop airing indian material , because this is only indicating that pakistani media have nothing to show on their channels excepts indian material which is cheap in cost but harmful for new and young generation. 24 hours transmission should only be allowed to new channels while entertainment channels should be restricted from 3pm-11pm."

80815,The show hosted by hamza ali abasi during ramzan He bring out the issue regarding qadyanis and questioned the government's authority and the costitution of pakistan He should be sued by the authorities as Television is not the place where you can speak whatever you want to TV shows stars should not be the ones to host Islamic educational programs

81032,The Ramzan transmission by the aforementioned channel after the aftar timings turns into something that seems very derogatory to the participants of the show and also to the respect for the holy month. The host has already been in the public eye for many more controversial acts of his such as degrading the participants of his show and his general behaviour throughout the show. I think the host of the show Dr. Amir Liaquat Hussain should be stopped from doing the show and the new host should be told in advance how to behave towards the audience as well as the guests.

I Have a question Does there is any deficit of Religious Scholars in our country? If you want that Ramadan transmission to continue they should be hosted by religious scholars not by theses tv anchors and fake scholars. which promote obscence(by hayai) throughout the year and then come to preach us religion in this month. So being a muslim do some legislation on this."
81167,I personally get offended by Amir liaqat's show inaam ghar. I feel that he is disrespecting the rank of an Alim Get rid of Amir liaqat
81168,"Unethical and non islamic programmes being conducted by Dr Amir Liaqat. Illogical and irrelevant things being done on the name of islamic programme. No benefit of such programme to viewers regarding islamic issues. On other hand, he is creating wrong image of islamic scholors on media and international media. So please stop him. Ban Amir Liaqat to do any islamic show during Ramazan"

81170,It was unfair on Pemra's part to ban Hamza Ali Abbasi for discussing about Ahmedia Muslims. Why could Pemra never impose a ban Maulanas who appear on various channels and spread hatred and intolerance through their speeches. It seems Pemra and the Pakistani government certainly support intolerance which is the main cause of terrorism in Pakistan. Pemra should not ban shows which discuss human rights or tolerance but instead ban those shows that spread hatred and negativity among viewers.
81171,I am submitting complaint against a show aired on Geo Ent. hosted by AMIR LIAQAT regarding Ramazan Transmission .... The reason is clear that the show highly opposite to the Islamic ethics and morals and the people are buzy wasting this precious time in the shows rather they should be buzy in their Ibadah' The show should be at first hand banned completely. In fact all the shows in Ramazan that contain mixed gatherings in them and are useless with regards to our Akhirah' should be banned as they are against the sanctity of this Month ... I hope you get my point ...
81172,"I want you to immediately close the programme ""Inaam Ghar"" of DR AMIR LIAQUAT HUSSAIN and issue a strict warning to ""Jeete Pakistan"" of Fahad Mustafa. Amir liaqaut often does unethical and immoral things in his programme which are completely unacceptable for a family audience.further he invites actors with inappropriate dressing.He also provokes his audience to do unethical things. and for Fahad Mustufa,ye often gives disgusting tasks to its audience which I have on Question for you? Is there any deficit of religious scholars in our country. If you permit ramadan transmission,then it should only be hosted by religious scholars and people with good credibility.Not by the actors and fake scholars which promote obscene (by hayai) in our society throughout the year and then come to preach us islam during this holy month. So i want to take some serious notice on these transmissions and define a criteria for the hosts of these transmissions."
81173,"Ramzan Transmissions are not according to the true Islamic Teachings.. Amir Liaquat has some serious problems with Shia Ulma in his 'Alim and Alam' section, which may arise some furious feelings in Ahl e Tashi.. Also when the Ramzan Transmission ends then Amir Liaquat shows his evil face to society which is not suitable for an Alim (Like He did with his tongue gesture in Inam Ghar).. Should ban Amir Liaquat from doing Ramzan Transmission and Inam Ghar.."
81174,He manages such a program which is named as Islamic. It has nothing to do with Islam. In short the person (Amir liaquat) suppose to urges people to do some disrespectful activities in program for the sake of awards. Moreover his behaviour with people is so awkward and obsessive. His program after iftar should be banned. Hope so pemra will do good step. With the alternate option available I think you should go for some religious Quiz program so that Pakistan can be able to get some religious knowledge. Thank you
81175,Inappropriate content in this holy month of Ramzan. Dance and music in the name of RAMZAN transmission Put a ban on amir Liaquat's show
81176,Making fun of the Holy Month of Ramzan and compromising its true essence Program should be banned or its format should be modified into some sensible format

Firstly after a lots of complain Amir liaquat should be banned because what so ever he telecast under the heading of Ramadan Transmission has nothing to do with islam and Ramadan.

81229,Hamza Ali Abbasi should not have been banned. He is just asking for a discussion on Ahmedis and Blasphemy Law. Let him record a program and PEMRA can then approve it before it is telecast.
81230,"Dear Pemra, Please if you can do thing something for Islam and Morals. Please stop Amir Liaqat in Ramazan at least his stupid behavior and Songs segment in Ramzan holy month. He is giving enough pain to all muslims. I am realy happy that you banned Hamza Abbasi on his controversial talk about Qadyani. Amir Liaqat making joke for Islam as earlier also he did. e.g. ""Jis kay gally main nabi ka patta hai usko dupatty ki zaroorat nahi. However Quran said about Pardah. but he is making joke of Quran. He abuse Hazra Abu bakar siddique in Past. Many things for him but no one have courage to stop this stupidity act which giving pain to all muslims specialy overseas like me.

Put ban on all Ramzan Transmission from the next year, Pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeee"
81237,Hamza Ali Abbasi should be banned for his last breath as he heart muslims and talked about Ahmadi who are not believe on our beloved last prophet Hazrat Muhammad S.A.A.W. I want life time ban and he should apologise or other case should be poisoned. Thank you Hamza Ali Abbasi should apologise or prisoned for shameful act he did and should be life time banned.

Also check other channels as well, because by hey all copy Amir Liaqat show"

81242,"The statement issued by Maulana Kookab Noori regarding Hamza Ali Abbassi's discussion on the Ahmedi community very plainly suggested an act of violence to be taken against him. He blatantly said on live TV that a traitor in the army is should be shot on the spot, and if it comes to it, others should make use of this action outside the army. This is a serious concern regarding incitement of violence and murder and it will prove to take a negative effect on the population. My suggestion is to prevent or ban those who incite violence through their negative influence and to hold Maulana Kookab Noorani accountable for this false action and prevent him from being able to raise such a murderous voice on live TV as well as hold TV One accountable for airing such a distressful message to many viewers. Also, do make sure that those who only have simple discussions without the influence of murderous, negative or intention of inciting violence should continue to be allowed to raise their voices, such as that of Hamza Ali Abbassi."
81243,Just ban Amir Liaquat.. As he is breaking the respect of Ramazan Koi tareeqa nahi hay us me.. Chichora hay.. I'm requesting to please ban him just like you habe banned Hamza Ali Abbasi..

Can we do these stupid things in other months instead of Ramadan? I have many things to say not only Geo but others channels as well and PEMRA is solely responsible for this. If you can't stop this and take action then wait for Allah's torment and we all will be deserving this.

Private channels under huge and heavy sponsorship do whatever they can for their ratings in the name of entertainment but I don't see Pemra taking steps against them. What our nation is heading to, is the consequence of what our media propagates with its filthy and unethical content.. Ramadhan was never like this four or five years back. So take immediate and necessary steps to make Ramadhan Transmission looks like one.."
81495,"""Pak-Ramzan transmission"" which is hosted by Amir Liaquatabad, who is violating on name of Islamic show or ramzan transmission, acting loved on songs when participants singing which is too odd in an ramzan transmission, got dressed like Angel Tahir Shah, acting Dead in front of others female Drama Artist, and many more thing they had done in their show, & still continued..... Saying online in his transmission that ""NAAOZUBILLAH"" ""Tawaf-e-Kaba"" band krwao phly phr ye show bnd hoga. saying this is like a clear Slap on the face of PEMRA Authority. I suggest to banned this transmission, & hold lifetime banned on Amir Liaquat for doing these kind of acts. these acts are too enough for banned. In the name of ""ALLAH"" & on the favor of Ramzan Transmission, it's very bad to these acts. I appreciates PEMRA on the Banned of Hamza Ali Abbas. he should be banned over all media channels for life time for non believing in ""ALLAH"" & Prophet ""MUHAMMAD"" he has a doubt in ""Khatm-e-Nabuwat"" which is declare by asking more & more time about this."

What msg does the channel want to send to the world? If companies want publicity, they should spend on ads, not on giving away in luckydraws... which by the way the mullah host himself should know is a haraam practice. Anything won in lucky draw is not earned n thus is haraam on you. What kind of islam are we portraying? Just replace the show with something based on Quranic tafseer or Seerat-un-Nabi (pbuh). People need to know what Islam is. They dont want to see participany fighting like animals for an opporyunity to win a silly phone."
81499,"Dear PEMRA crew, i am here because i want to talk about some TV shows. Like Inam Ghar and other Morning shows hosted by any kind of any female celebrity or so called islamic scholars.

Dr amir liaqat sb, so called religious scholar, his program is full of shit. in respect of ramzan we must control our TV transmission so that we can create Islamic environment at least in Ramzan. So that we can turn ourselves toward islam at least in Holy month of Ramzan. I""ll also mention some morning shows hosted by female celebrities. in those morning shows, there is not any kind of any sign of respect regarding ramzan. setup some special programs regarding Ramzan and call only authentic Islamic Scholars. there must be some programs regarding Tafseer e Quran and Ahadees. Tafeer e quran program, in which Tafseer of Quran Pak elaborate by some 3 4 authentic islamic Scholars. Tafssr of Quran Pak regarding our social life, our daily routine and how we make ourselves to a good Muslims .. such kind of programs must be on TV instead of other useless programs. thank you so much."

Such Time and other talk shows at the channel are advancing vile propaganda and sectarian vitriol. PEMRA should ban such a massive violation of local laws.

These belong to gossip channels, not news channels. Secondly, when the news started, for a whole minute channel showed different vulgar poses of the model. Why was this necessary? I have seen only GEO News. Most probably this behavior may be present on other channels also. News channels should focus on news, and refrain from gossips."
81854,Morning Shows/After Iftar game shows that in no way represent our Ideology and Culture and are misleading the nation! Please take notice of these notorious talkshows/game shows that are aired after iftar and in the morning as none of them represent the Islamic ideology nor the culture of Pakistan. These dances and singing are against the teachings of Islam and moving generation towards the wrong path!
81855,Channel 24 aired a program Kharasuch with Mubashir Luqman at 2pm on 22nd June 2016. The program had the model Qandeel Baloch as a guest. The model was wearing vulgar dress which is against the norms of Eastern society. Additionally it is surprising that how can such dresses and models be allowed in Ramzan. At least the host Mubashir Luqman should show some respect for Ramzan. Kindly send a strict message to all the channels to not allow vulgar models and dresses on air. At least this instruction should be followed for Ramzan. Strict measures should be taken and Pemra should have a keen eye over such programs so that these programs can be stopped on the spot before airing such stupid and indecent stuff.

81886,"Hooliganism in Ramazan transmission on various channels. Sanctity of the month is lost by showing stadium shaped studios with mix gathering of men and women, laughing and clapping on silly idiotic jokes and acts by the hosts. They are promoting begging amongst masses and encouraging them to compromise on their dignity in order to obtain gift hampers. Strict regulation should be done on the content of Ramazan transmission. It is a sacred month. Try to retain its sanctity by not involving in games and music. Ramzan doesnot end with iftar. So such programmes should be banned altogether even after iftar. One does not need stupid entertaintment!"
81887,"This is humble request in the name of Allah, please stop the Ramzan Transmission on these Channles. One person. Dr. Amir Liaqat, making faces like dog and entertaining audiance...is this a way to act in Ramzan.

81889,There is a footage from a recent Ramzan Transmission that has gone viral on social media about a woman not being able to recognise a picture of President of Pakistan Mr Mamnoon Hussain. Waseem Badami (the show host) and Junaid Jamshed (guest) are seen as utterly enjoying the situation and making fun out of it. These two gentlemen are indirectly causing embarrassment to the President of Pakistan and hurting sentiments of the whole nation in a very crude and darogatory way. ARY Digital should be warned to stop airing such programming in future.

81898,Anchors are shown eating food during roza. The program Geo Pakistan at 9.30 AM on 27.06.2016 showed a segment in which the anchors are eating food while showing how to present Iftar. The anchors should show some respect for Ramzan and Roza not the viewers. I cannot understand the logic of this!!! The anchors want to promote the values of Ramzan and showing how to present Iftar in a wonderful way but it is not necessary for the anchor to eat it and express how wonderful it is during the Roza.

81965,I have two complaints: 1). News Channels / Headlines are giving the impression that every thing is wrong in Pakistan and is creating very bad image. 2). Islamic / Religious programs are not in line with Islamic guidelines. Channels are not allowed to show news that creates negative image of the country. Islamic council should prepare guidelines for religious programs and should be inline with capacity building of the people of Pakistan.

82129,There have been some recent events in the show which were not good for viewers in any way and direct action is to be needed.Aamir Liaquat in shab qadr bayan in his show supported MQM in a way which was very inappropriate and misleading. He also talked about Quaid-e-Azam amd his sister in order to support MQM. Despite this one recent event has occured in Inaam ghar in which Sherry and a Random guy was rolling in between the set which was disturbing.Inaam ghar also features music after iftar and shows it as permissible in Islam. Please shut down this channel till Eid because we don't want to watch his shows anymore.

Actually, he sung this song on the eve of 27th of Ramadan which is the Islamic birth date of my country Pakistan. This is totally unacceptable to sing an indian song which contains the phrases like ""Phir bhi Dil Hai Hindustani"". Pakistan was founded on 27th of Ramadan as per Hijri Calendar and we celebrate our independence day on this date too..why he sung this indian song on this day in live transmission? My suggestion is to warn Aamir Liaqat to not to repeat such things on such special days. and also send notice to Geo TV to stop the promotion of indian songs.. Thank You"

Is this Islam? he is making joke of the religion on the name of humanity and sharing smiles on the faces of poor people.

82217,"I would like to highlight to PEMRA the utter defiance of GEO Group towards Pakistani cultural values and the teachings of Islam. I would refer to the episode of the program ""Aik Din Geo Kay Sath"" which was aired on July 6, 2016 with Qandeel Baloch as a guest. The guest not only spoke openly about her striptease offer which she made earlier but tried to justify it. In addition, the channel broadcast her swimming footage which was in extremely tight clothes. Due to airing of such material on Eid Day, such program hurt the feelings of many Pakistanis. We as a nation are getting worse day by day as we have lost the sense of islamic values and teachings in the name of ratings. Moreover, as a nation we are now teaching our youth to become a slut to gain fame and recognition. I would urge Chairman PEMRA to ban airing of this program until GEO News submits an apology to the Pakistani nation. I hope PEMRA does have the rights and the power to take GEO NEWS head on to restore Pakistani culture and the reign in the vulgarity."

Strict action must be taken against news channel to not show such content where they are abusing young kids like Abdullah who doesn't even know what killing or dead means! They shouldn't be allowed to go to the deceased family's home because even if the family is allowing them there are viewers who do not find the content good at all and their emotions can get hurt plesse take strict action against them.

The complaint is regarding Express News' transmission dated 09.07.2016, showing a news reporter of Express News reporting whilst lying inside the grave of Late Mr. Abdul Sattar Edhi with the headline stating 'Abdul Sattar Edhi's Aakhri Aaraam Gah'. The Reporter's act and the Express News' audacity of allowing such an act is highly inappropriate and illegal under s.20 of the PEMRA Ordinance 2002. This shows the lows our media channels can stoop to for mere views and ratings. This was an insensitive, distasteful and a disgusting tactic used by Express News which is against our religion, our beliefs and our morals. Please take necessary action against the Licensee of Express News."
82552,Reporter had done vulgar act.. He disrespected abdul sitar edhi... Action should be taken against them.. Nothing
82553,the way they present the funeral of Abdul Sattar Edhi Ban the reporter and Fine them heavily

82558,"This is regarding a news clip from this channel in which a young boy's mother has just died and the news reporter is at his home making him 'act' out the script she is giving him to speak in front of camera. The poor boy is being pressurised repeatedly to act in front of the camera. This is not news reporting but staged drama which is also very cruel. These channels are literally invading anyone's privacy just for the sake of making money. News reporting means 'reporting' of truth. So news channels should be asked not to force people to repeat their script. And if the people are happy to do it, it should be labelled as drama and not news!"
82560,I need to register my complaint for the unethical reporting by express news as the reporter was lying in edhi Sahab's grave...I don't know what they are trying to show... The second complaint relates to Geo news in which a lady reporter is playing with the emotions of a small child ABDULLAH... this cheap media has crossed all limits just for the sake of Trp's.... There needs to b some proper guidelines and boundaries defined for these media channels...
82561,"Live reporting from the grave ! (Aakhri Araamgah of Eidhi) I mean seriously??? :O which channel ever did this in the whole world before??? This is redicilious at all.

My niece literally asked me seeing this live ""chachu dekhain zinda aadmi qabar me betha batain kr raha hai"" and I'd nothing to answer him except truning off the t.v. Immediately block transmissions of the concerned channel (Express news) at least for one day and charge them heavy fine. Send the notices to all other national media channels to avoid such pathetic reportings otherwise they will also have to face the same as i suggested above. Thank you."
82562,"The coverage of Edhi's funeral included one reporter reporting while lying in his empty grave. It was extremely ridiculous and disrespectful. Picture is available at the link: http://imgur.com/a/bgq4g There is a need of a guideline for respectful coverage, and a need for imposing fines and/or bans on channels and reporters who violate it. There was a reporter on Dawn News today who was speaking to one of the residents of Edhi's homes who was mentally disabled, and the reporter's question made him burst into tears on camera. Even earlier, on Eid, several TV channels were reporting from Amjad Sabri's home, and exploiting his family's grief. This kind of coverage is not dignified, and freedom of expression aside, channels need to be admonished when they indulge in this kind of reporting."
82563,I have a complaint against the unethical news reporting showcased by Express news where the reporter climbs down to the grave of Abdul Sattar Edhi in order to show to the world his final resting place. Why is there a need to go through such tactics in race for higher TRPs. I condemn such acts and urge Pemra to impose high penalties or at least a rule book for such mindless reporting fanatics. The reporter should not be lurking around Edhi's or for that matter any person's grave. Unethical reporting should be made as a unified law and lawbreakers should be bought to justice. I suggest Pemra to have open eyes regarding what airs on channels to. Its the national television we're talking about.

I was shocked that every year we are stepping forward and developing such mindset which is used to of watching evil and sinful things on our tv channels. I felt that we are in a race with Bollywood for nudity. A reasonable man with little moral can’t even sit with family to look at them. It is so shameful that PEMRA despite having such code of conduct, is unable to take actions against those people who are destroying the minds of our next generations. I do not know how much conscience you have left with to read my email and take action, but i know that Pakistan is going toward ""destruction"". Not the destruction in physical mean but destruction of our younger generations. You people are responsible for it. verily, you have to stand in front of Allah and answer of all you have commit. If you felt any shame after reading my complaints, show your courage and remove these channels and bar these celebrities who are destroying our families and children coming in channels and news.
